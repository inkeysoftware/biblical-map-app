# Biblical Map App - Update Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Map Images Not Loading**
   - The application was incorrectly looking for map images at `/C:/assets/maps/` instead of the `base-maps` folder
   - Maps are now properly loaded from the `./base-maps/` directory relative to the application executable
   - Added protocol handler to correctly resolve file:// URLs

2. **Static Resources Not Loading**
   - CSS and JS files were being requested from incorrect absolute paths (`file:///C:/static/css/`)
   - Fixed HTML paths by adding a <base href="./"> tag and updating all resource URLs to be relative
   - Enhanced path resolution in electron-main.js to properly handle resource loading

## Implementation Details

### MapPane.js
- Updated map URL resolution to detect packaged app vs development environment
- Added better logging of map loading status
- Enhanced error handling for map loading failures

### fix-html-paths.js
- Expanded to handle more path types
- Added insertion of base href tag
- Fixed paths for CSS and JS files to use relative references

### electron-main.js
- Added protocol handler for file:// URLs
- Improved path resolution for application resources
- Enhanced logging of app startup and loading errors

### debug-map-loading.js
- Created comprehensive map testing HTML file
- Added utilities to check all referenced maps exist
- Provides visual confirmation of map loading

### New Tools
- **verify-path-resolution.js**: Checks and validates path resolution
- **verify-and-fix-paths.bat**: Batch script to run all path fixing tools
- **test-map-loading-comprehensive.bat**: Enhanced testing of map loading
- **build-and-test.bat**: Complete build and test process

## How to Use

### For Development
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run build` to build the React app
3. Run `verify-and-fix-paths.bat` to ensure paths are correct
4. Run `npm run electron-prod` to test in production mode

### For Distribution
1. Run `build-release.bat` to create a complete distribution
2. Test the distribution using `test-build.bat`

### For Troubleshooting
1. Run `debug-map-loading.js` to create the map-tester.html
2. Open map-tester.html in a browser to verify map loading
3. Check console logs for specific error messages

## Future Improvements
- Add automated tests for resource loading
- Consider bundling maps into the app itself rather than external folder
- Implement more robust error handling for missing resources
